## Overview

Reconquer Engine is an MMORPG game engine and framework for creating games with mechanics somewhat similar to Old School Runescape (OSRS). It is currently used for the game [Reconquer Online](https://news.reconquer.online/). This repository contains not only the engine files, but also all the assets for running a local copy of Reconquer Online!

It uses native web technology for user interfaces and (**three.js**) for graphics and therefore runs in a browser or an electron app. The backend uses **Express** and **Socket.io** for a server and real time communication. The exporter, which combines game assets and generates server and client configs, uses **gltf-transform**.

This version uses a simple local file database and simple authentication system that should generally be replaced in production deployments.

## Architecture

1. **Assets**: Contains all game assets.
2. **Exporter**: Processes and optimizes assets.
3. **Client**: Contains browser client code.
4. **Server**: Node.js server using express and socket.io.
